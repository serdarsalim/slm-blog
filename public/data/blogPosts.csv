TRUE,1,First Post,first-post,"Life in this world is short, work for your eternity","بسم الله الرحمان الرحيم  

<p>Hi reader! </p>

<p> Welcome to my first post </p>

Message to myself and to other people:

1) Whatever you're doing in this world do it for the good of yourself and people around you
2) Work on stuff to create meaningful value
3) Aspire to inspire before you expire
4)Lists don't work yet but they will soon


Creating a better world. By helping one person at a time and maybe one day at scale. 



You came this far to my blog, to come this far. What does that all mean? 

This post is a work in progress. So you might see edits. I don't really have a version control in this post. Should I build it? I don't know? Maybe that's also a good idea. You let me know.

Also. I wrote that post fully on my Google Sheet post composer. Awesome isn't it? I wonder if this thing loads on mobile too. We'll figure it out. 

Also for what it's worth, none of this text is generated, aided or in any form edited by AI. These are all my own thoughts typed in by my fingers. 

Thanks for reading.

TRUE,2,Personal Finance is important,personal-finance-is-important,It's important to have personal budget and investment plan,"<p>ه I came to realization that I need a professional budget and investment plan far too late in life. But it's never too late. You should invest in a diversified portfolio. Whatever you're making from your job won't give you the freetime you deserve in this life to do the things you're really interested in. The goal isn't making more money the goal is to having more freedome to determine what exactly to do with your short time in this world. Unfortunately the currency of time is also to some extent the fiat currency. If you don't have it you must sometimes give your time to people and tasks that are not within your interest. So earn enough money to do the thing that aligns with your purpsose. Purpose? I think that's a great 3rd post topic! As will all other posts, this post is a WIP and will be refined. Human worker here, things go slow without AI.

TRUE,3,You need a purpose,you-need-a-purpose,Every sound person on this world needs to deeply think what's their purpose,"<p>ه Purpose driven life is one of the most fulfilled ways to live. It gives energy, courage and fullfilment nothing else can give in this world. So my dear reader find your purpose and live it. It can be tough at times but it will pay out in the end. I hope it does. If it doesn't don't hold me accountable. But I will be purpose driven. Hey SLM, what's your purpose? My purpose is to solve problems and add value in other people's lives. That's a very broad one I know. But right now one of the ways I'm doin git is I'm building online tools, specifically involving spreadsheets to have more impact on achieving this. My goal is to help people. If your purpose align with mine reach out and let's find together how we can do this better. Making the world a better place. One person at a time. Thanks for reading. yes you do.</p>",SLM,2025-03-20,personal,https://unsplash.com/photos/nN5L5GXKFz8/download?ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MXxhbGx8fHx8fHx8fHwxNzQyNDU4NjcxfA&force=true&w=640,FALSE
TRUE,4,Why spreadsheets are great in personal life,why-spreadsheets-are-great-in-personal-lif,Spreadsheets are a great tool to use if you want to boost your productivity ,"Let me start by saying that I don't like Google's stance on many things and they are getting a lot of things wrong, specifically getting involved with agencies and countries that put an end to human life.

I'm against that.

But without getting carried away too much from the topic I use a lot of Google services that makes my life easier.

Spreadsheets are definitely one of human's greatest invention and Google Sheets are one of the best for personal use. 

I actually stopped using Microsoft Excel a long time ago. I don't think I can go back.

But if you use spreadsheets continue, it doesn't matter who created it. ",SLM,2025-03-20,spreadsheets,https://unsplash.com/photos/mcSDtbWXUZU/download?ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MXxzZWFyY2h8Mnx8c3ByZWFkc2hlZXRzfGVufDB8fHx8MTc0MjQ1OTIwNXww&force=true&w=640,FALSE
FALSE,5,Be for justice but against violence,be-for-justice-but-against-viol,Do not cause death and destruction in the world,"I'm not a pacifist but I don't believe in harming civilians during a conflict. There should be no excuse to put an end to life of civilians period. I find what Israel is doing in Palestine disgusting. Everyone who is right in their mind can see that they're doing this to expand their territory and not for their security. What's happening there is a genocide. So The world needs to know that. 

If you're someone who's on the same page with me thank you for being one and reading this blog.

If you're someone who believes otherwise please exit this blog. I want to be as far away from you people as possible. 

As all my other articles this article is an ongoing WIP.

So if you have the privilege of time and financial means travel the world. Don't be afraid, most people you'll meet will be very kind. The world is full of kind and helpful people contrary what the media constantly bombards us with.

Where should you go?

ChatGPT is amazing folks. 

I use those daily:

ChatGPT
Claude


I think I should use other models too. 

Rejently I've been watching some YouTube videos from Andrej Karphaty. That dude is cool.

If you ever read my blog man, you're cool


This article is of course WIP and can change anytime.


Computers are like bycicles to our brain
The internet is like a car
I think AI is a plane

What's the logical next step to this thing?
